Snake game

## Bugs
* There's a line or column outside of the screen. Sometimes the player goes there and disappears from the screen and sometimes the food is generated in that area and is unreacheable
* Snake can go from down to up directly and vice versa and right to left directly and vice versa


## Features
* Implement gameover when hitting walls
* Implement gameover when the snake hits itself
* Stylize the game
