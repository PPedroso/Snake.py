Snake game

## Bugs
* At the start of the programm, the coordinates start at unit 1 so no colision is detected
* There's a line or column outside of the screen. Sometimes the player goes there and disappears from the screen and sometimes the food is generated in that area and is unreacheable


## Features
* Make the snake grow when consumming the good
* Implement gameover when hitting walls
* Implement gameover when the snake hits itself
* Stylize the game
